            <p id="scroll-text">... there lived a little country girl,<br>
                the prettiest creature who was ever seen.<br>
                Her mother had a little red riding hood made for her.<br>
                Everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.<br>
                One evening her mother said to her:<br>
                “Go my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing,<br>
                for I hear she has been very ill.”<br>
                Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately.<br>
                As she was going through the wood, the full moon enligthened her way.<br>
                If her mother had been aware of the full moon,<br>
                she would never let her daughter go through the forest.<br>
                Due to the full moon, the wolves out there no longer were just wolves...<br>
                ... they got to turn into werewolves, murderous and bloodthirsty.<br>
                <br>
                But Little Red Riding Hood wasn't helpless.<br>
                Grown up far away from civilization, she was used to bow-hunt,<br>
                and she spent most of her childhood outdoors,<br>
                what made her a strong and agile young lady.<br>
                <br>
                Help Little Red Riding Hood reach her grandmother's house!<br>
